# Summary
This project dives into understanding a small business’s customer base and measuring how well its marketing campaigns are performing&mdash;all using Excel. Customer segmentation helps businesses get a clearer picture of their audience, while comparing campaign results shows whether they’re reaching the right people. These insights shape smarter marketing strategies. With Excel’s built-in **functions**, **PivotTables**, and **visualizations**, analysts can break down the data effectively. A well-designed dashboard brings everything together, giving decision-makers the key takeaways at a glance.

# Scenario
**ABC Food Store**, a local grocery store in a small city&mdash;think Charlottesville, Virginia&mdash;is looking to grow and strengthen its customer base through targeted marketing campaigns. So far, company leaders have launched six campaigns, but they need to know if these efforts are actually working. Now, it's up to the company’s data analyst to assess campaign performance and provide insights that will inform future marketing strategies. By analyzing **customer segmentation**, **purchase patterns**, and **campaign engagement**, the analyst can help optimize marketing efforts for better results.

This project uses customer segmentation and campaign analysis 

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
